# ArtPortfolio.github.io

I've been interested in art from a very young age. I wanted to be able to access my art in a faster and quicker method, than always having to pull out my physical copies. Instead of using an online website creator, I decided to learn JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create an online Art Portfolio.

This website contains my bullet journal, sketches, water colour, and arcylic paintings.
